# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### Adaptiveness
Currently the application has one breakpoint at 600px

### State management
It uses redux-saga 1.1.3

### Tests
There are only some components/reducers covered with tests. I decided not to test all components, because they have very basic functionality and similar test cases. All tests were written with jest and react testing library.  

### Docs
The whole project was written in typescript, which gives a clear image of input parameters and return types of different functions, methods, etc.
